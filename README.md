Encryption Works

How to Protect Your Privacy in the Age of NSA Surveillance
----------------------------------------------------------

The original whitepaper I wrote for Freedom of the Press Foundation can be found at [https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/encryption-works](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/encryption-works), and in the "original" folder.

This version has been converted to markdown so it can be easily tracked in git and collaboratively edited. The guide itself is in encryption_works.md.

Pull requests welcome.
